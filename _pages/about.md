<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a PhD student at Petr Sulc's Lab, Arizona State University. I am currently persuing computational biophysics with focus on self assembly of genetic materials. I am highly invested in developing coarse grain model of DNA which would allow us to study these assembly at a much quicker pace, otherwise impossible with atomistic approach. I also work with Machine Learning models that could even simplify our life by predicting desired properties without even going through computationally intensive simulations where ever possible. I undertake other application based project like dna cryptography and storage.
