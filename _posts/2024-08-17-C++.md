#### Ofstream file opening parameters

- `std::ios::ate` - full file is available for writting and the pointer will be at the end of the file in the beginning.
- `std::ios::app` - starts writting at the end of the file and existing porting is non writable.
- `std::ios::trunc` - will delete everything in the file and starts writting afresh.
- `std::ios::out` - used to creat a file if doesn't exists, writting behaviour is dependant on `trunc` or `ate` etc.
- `std::ios::binary` - most useful mode to generate binary files.
