I will discuss basic operation that might be helpful.

1. Extend partition size for a LVM partitons.

Check disk configuration using the following commands `fdisk -l`, `lsblk`, `vds`, `pvs`. To make changes to the virtual partition one need to change the /dev/mapper section no need to change any properties of /dev/sd\* or /dev/nvme\*. Using `lvextend --size *size*G /dev/mapper/*partitionName*` for my case this was `lvextend --size 236G /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`. Now update the filesystem `resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`. Using `df -h \ ` one can verify if the changes have been implemented.

### Conclusion

LVM is great tool for those who are looking forward to robust but less fancy dynamic partition management system. BTRFS is much simplier and easier to implement but CPU usage can rise compared to LVM-ext4, hence many prefer LVM for server systems.
