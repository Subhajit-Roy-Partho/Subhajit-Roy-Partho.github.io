How do you feel when you exercise too much? Have you ever wondered why you get those muscle cramps when you run very fast?  

=> Anaerobic respiration is the culprit to be blamed. Cramps occur when muscle cells respire anaerobically. Partial breakdown of glucose, due to lack of oxygen, produces lactic acid and the accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle cramps. That is why a hot shower after heavy sports relieve the cramps as it improves blood circulation in the body, which in turn enhances the supply of oxygen to the cells.
