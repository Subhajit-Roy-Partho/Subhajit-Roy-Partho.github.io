![Important Questions for Class 10 Maths Chapter 10 Circles 2](https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-10-Circles-2.png)
∠1 = ∠2
∠1 + ∠2 + 100° = 180°
∠1 + ∠1 = 80°
⇒ 2∠1 = 80°
⇒ ∠1 = 40°
∠1 + ∠BAT = 90°
∠BAT = 90° – 40° = 50°

Question 2.
In the given figure, PA and PB are tangents to the circle with centre O. If ∠APB = 60°, then calculate ∠OAB, (2011D)

Solution:
![Important Questions for Class 10 Maths Chapter 10 Circles 4](https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-10-Circles-4.png)
∠1 = ∠2
∠1 + ∠2 + ∠APB = 180°
∠1 + ∠1 + 60° = 180°
2∠1 = 180° – 60° = 120°
∠1 = 120∘2 = 60°
∠1 + ∠OAB = 90°
60° +∠OAB = 90°
∠OAB = 90° – 60° = 30°

∠1 = ∠2
∠1 + ∠2 + 70° = 180°
∠1 + ∠1 = 180° – 70°
2∠1 = 110° ⇒ ∠1 = 55°
∠1 + ∠TPQ = 90°
55° + ∠TPQ = 90°

As we know,
AF = AD
CF = CE
BD = BE
Let AD = AF = x cm
then, DB = AB – AD

∴ BE = (12 – x) cm ..[Tangents drawn from an external point are equal
Similarly,
CF = CE = AC – AF = (10 – x) cm
BC = 8 cm …[Given
⇒ BE + CE = 8 ⇒ 12 – x + 10 – x = 8
⇒ 22 – 8 = 2x ⇒ 2x = 14

BE = 12 – x = 12 – 7 = 5 cm
CF = 10 – x = 10 – 7 = 3 cm

Solution:
PA = PB …[Tangents drawn from an external point are equal
Given:
∠APB = 60°
∠PAB = ∠PBA … (i) …(Angles opposite to equal sides
In ∆PAB, ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠APB = 180° …[Angle-sum-property of a ∆

We get,
⇒ 2x + 2y + 2z = 10 + 8 + 12
⇒ 2(x + y + z) = 30
⇒ x + y + z = 15
⇒ 10 + z = 15 … [From (i)
