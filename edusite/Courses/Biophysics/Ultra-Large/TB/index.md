### General Comment

- Transferase is mostly associated with rupture of lipid membrance in different host cells by replacing some important groups. Though not directly but indirectly by forming other proteins. 50

- Reductase:Producing new amino acids. 80

- Hydrolase: Similar to reductase but chemical pathway is different. Where Reductase is NADPH base small amino acid production, hydrolase produces both large and smalll bio-molecules. 5

- Lyase: Different from all other class, not much known of the pathway. Mostly involved in antibiotic. 23

- Isomerase: Not very important and carry out variety of secondary functions like gluycolysis, chemical conversion etc. 11

-Ligase: Many functions. Few prominant NAD+ reaction similar to reductase. 36
